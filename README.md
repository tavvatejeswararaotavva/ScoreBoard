# ScoreBoard

This Java program is a command-line application for managing a player scoreboard in a MySQL database. It offers a menu-driven interface with the following options:

1. **View Records**: Display all player records from the "scoreboard" table.
2. **Create Record**: Add a new player's record to the database.
3. **Update Record**: Modify a player's runs and the number of balls played.
4. **Delete Record**: Remove a player's record from the database.
5. **Exit**: Terminate the program.

The project establishes a database connection and uses SQL queries to perform these operations based on user input. It provides a simple way to interact with and manage player records.
